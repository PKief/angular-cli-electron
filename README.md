# Angular Cli + Electron

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1.

The Angular project is wrapped in an Electron environment, that enables you to start the application in a separate window on your desktop.

## Further description

The description of the project can be found in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@PhilippKief/angular-desktop-apps-a9ce9e3574e8).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm start` to run the app in an Electron dev environment with auto-reload.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Packaging

Run `npm run package:all` to package the Electron app into executables that can be easily shipped for all platforms. Otherwise you can run e.g. `npm run package:win` to create executables only for Windows, same with `npm run package:linux` for Linux and `npm run package:mac` for Mac.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Add support for file system ([no official support](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4227)):

Create a file called `native.js` in the `src` folder and insert the following:

```js
window.fs = require('fs');
```

Add this file to the `.angular-cli.json` scripts array:

```json
"scripts": [
    "native.js"
],
```

Add the following lines to `polyfills.ts`:

```ts
declare global {
    interface Window {
        fs: any;
    }
}
```

After that you can access the filesystem with:

```ts
window.fs.writeFileSync('sample.txt', 'my data');
```
